# Challenge: Fallout

Claim ownership of the contract below to complete this level.

# Solution

There's only one way to become owner - the Fallout function. This is using solidity 0.6.0 so the constructor is the name of the contract. So the only way this is possible is if the constructor is named wrong, therefore anything can call it. Which it is! Fal1out != Fallout
